# Runbook — CLPR Kill Switch (`setClprEnabled(false)`)

**Audience:** on-call engineer responding to a live incident.
**Goal:** halt all state-changing activity on `ClprService` fast, safely, and reversibly — without waiting for the protocol designers.

> Read the [Triggers](#triggers) section before flipping the switch. Disabling
> the service stops **all** endpoints and connectors, not just the misbehaving
> one — it is a blunt, protocol-wide instrument. Use it when the blast radius of
> *not* acting is larger than the blast radius of halting.

## TL;DR — the flip

If you have already decided (see [Triggers](#triggers)) that halting is the right call:

**What you need first** (the `<…>` values used throughout this runbook):

- `<CLPR_SERVICE>` — the `ClprService` address. Find it in the "Owned contract"
  row of [`docs/safe-runbook.md`](../safe-runbook.md) §1, or in the deploy's
  address output (`CLPR_SERVICE` key).
- `<RPC_URL>` — an RPC endpoint for the target network.
- Access to the Safe's signers to reach the signing threshold.

```bash
# 1. Encode the call (this is the calldata the Safe tx must carry)
cast calldata "setClprEnabled(bool)" false
# → 0x52c3aa160000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
#   (this value is fixed; target contract = ClprService)

# 2. Sign + execute as a Safe transaction targeting ClprService.
#    Mechanics (hashing, collecting threshold signatures, executing) live in
#    docs/safe-runbook.md §3 "Routine owner-only operations".

# 3. VERIFY the flag actually changed (see "Verify it took effect" below).
#    A Safe tx with status 1 does NOT prove the halt landed.
cast storage <CLPR_SERVICE> 2 --rpc-url <RPC_URL> | cut -c25-26
# → "00" = halted
```

`setClprEnabled` is `onlyOwner`, and the owner is the Safe multisig, so flipping
the switch still requires the Safe's signing threshold. **You cannot do this
alone** — page co-signers early (see [Paging tree](#paging-tree)).

---

## What the kill switch does

- `setClprEnabled(false)` sets `_clprEnabled = false` and emits
  `ClprEnabledChanged(false)`.
- While disabled, **every protocol operation carrying the `whenEnabled` modifier
  reverts with `ClprDisabled()`**. That is all 16 of:

  | Area | Gated operations |
  |------|------------------|
  | Channels | `registerChannel`, `completeChannel`, `closeChannel` |
  | Connectors | `registerConnector`, `completeConnector`, `removeConnector`, `topUpConnectorStake` |
  | Endpoints | `registerEndpoint`, `removeEndpoint`, `evictEndpoint`, `topUpBond` |
  | Messaging | `sendMessage`, `redactMessage` |
  | Bundles | `submitBundle` |
  | Configuration | `updateLedgerConfiguration`, `updateEconomicConfiguration` |

- **Read-only views are unaffected** — off-chain monitoring and investigation
  continue to work.
- No funds move and no state is destroyed. Bonds and stakes stay locked in the
  contract exactly as they were.

### Three things the switch deliberately does *not* block

These mutating functions keep working while halted. The first is what makes the
switch safe to use; the other two are limits worth knowing before you flip.

- `setClprEnabled` itself is not gated, so the action is fully **reversible**
  with `setClprEnabled(true)`. Halting can never lock you out of un-halting.
- `collectPending()` is not gated. Anyone owed ETH through the pull-payment
  path can still withdraw it during a halt — a halt does not trap refunds. If
  your incident calls for freezing withdrawals too, **the kill switch is not
  the tool**; escalate, because no owner call achieves that.
- `transferOwnership` / `renounceOwnership` are plain `Ownable` functions and
  are not gated. `renounceOwnership` would leave the switch permanently stuck
  in its current state — never propose it during an incident.

---

## Triggers

The switch is worth flipping only when it actually reduces harm. For each
scenario below: confirm the signal, decide whether halting *helps*, then act.

| Trigger | Signals to look for | Does halting help? | Decision |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|----------|
| **Verifier compromise** | Bundles verifying that should not (forged proofs accepted), a disclosed vulnerability in the active verifier (Hiero / QBFT / Sei), or a trust-anchor key you no longer trust. | **Yes.** `submitBundle` runs `whenEnabled`; disabling stops all bundle processing, cutting off the exploit path immediately. | **Flip.** Then escalate to security — this is the highest-severity trigger. |
| **Peer-chain halt** | The peer chain has stopped finalizing / is reorging / is unreachable, so bundle proofs are stale or unverifiable. Watch for a spike in failed `submitBundle` calls or stuck cross-chain state. | **Usually yes**, if endpoints/connectors would otherwise act on stale peer-chain state or accrue incorrect slashes while the peer chain is down. | **Flip if** the halt is causing incorrect on-chain effects. If the system merely stalls harmlessly, halting may add little — prefer monitoring. |
| **Anomalous slash rate** | Connector `slashCount` climbing far faster than baseline; connectors approaching `slashBanThreshold` en masse; slashing that does not correspond to real misbehavior (possible logic bug or coordinated abuse). | **Yes**, to stop irreversible economic damage to honest connectors while you investigate. | **Flip** if slashing appears incorrect or runaway. Legitimate slashing of a single bad actor is **not** a reason to halt the whole protocol. |

If the situation does not clearly match a trigger above but you believe halting
is warranted, **page the escalation contacts and halt anyway** — a reversible
halt during an ambiguous incident is cheaper than data you cannot claw back. Err
toward flipping.

## Invocation via Safe (cast / CLI)

The switch is an `onlyOwner` call on `ClprService`, executed as a Safe
transaction whose **target is `ClprService`** and whose **calldata** is the
encoded `setClprEnabled(bool)` call.

```bash
# Encode calldata for the halt
cast calldata "setClprEnabled(bool)" false
```

Submit that calldata as a Safe transaction to the `ClprService` address, collect
the Safe's `<threshold>` signatures, and execute. The full signing procedure —
computing the hash, gathering signatures, executing — is in
[`docs/safe-runbook.md`](../safe-runbook.md) §3. The call reaches `AdminLogic`
via delegatecall and runs against the head's storage, where the owner check sees
the Safe.

Two mechanical traps in that procedure are worth knowing before you start. Both
are covered in §3:

- **Signatures must be concatenated in ascending signer-address order.** The
  correct number of individually-valid signatures in the wrong order fails with
  `GS026`. Too few fails with `GS020`.
- **Keep `safeTxGas` and `gasPrice` at `0`.** With a non-zero `safeTxGas`, a
  reverting inner call still produces a receipt with `status: 1 (success)`.

### Verify it took effect

**A successful Safe transaction is not proof that the halt landed.** The Safe can
authorize and execute a transaction whose inner call reverted: the receipt shows
`status: 1 (success)` and the Safe emits `ExecutionFailure` rather than
`ExecutionSuccess`. Always verify the flag itself.

```bash
# 1. AUTHORITATIVE CHECK — read _clprEnabled directly out of storage.
#    It is internal (no public getter), but it lives at byte offset 20 of
#    slot 2, packed immediately above the _bundleDecodeHelper address.
cast storage <CLPR_SERVICE> 2 --rpc-url <RPC_URL>
# halted:  0x000000000000000000000000<20-byte _bundleDecodeHelper address>
# enabled: 0x000000000000000000000001<20-byte _bundleDecodeHelper address>
#
#    _bundleDecodeHelper occupies the low 20 bytes (the trailing 40 hex chars),
#    so the flag byte is chars 25-26 of the 0x-prefixed word:
cast storage <CLPR_SERVICE> 2 --rpc-url <RPC_URL> | cut -c25-26
# → "00" while halted, "01" while enabled
#
#    Do NOT eyeball the leading zeros — the top bytes of the word read "00" in
#    both states.
```

> The slot number comes from `storage-layout.json` (`_clprEnabled`, slot 2,
> offset 20). `ClprService` is not upgradeable, so it cannot shift under a live
> deployment — but re-confirm it against `storage-layout.json` for the exact
> commit you deployed.

```bash
# 2. Confirm both events in the execution tx. `cast receipt` does NOT decode
#    logs, so match on topic0 by hand.
cast receipt <TX_HASH> --rpc-url <RPC_URL>
```

| Topic0 | Event | What you need to see |
|--------|-------|----------------------|
| `0x442e715f626346e8c54381002da614f62bee8d27386535b2521ec8540898556e` | `ExecutionSuccess` (from the Safe) | Present. If you instead see `ExecutionFailure` (`0x23428b18acfb3ea64b08dc0c1d296ea9c09702c09083ca5272e64d115b687d23`), **the halt did not happen.** |
| `0x229dad167f612424b3006f4bba5e443fe4d604c7c884fe483bfadac82339b10d` | `ClprEnabledChanged` (from `ClprService`) | Present, with `data` = `0x00…00` for the halt (`0x00…01` for a re-enable). |

```bash
# 3. Behavioural sanity check — confirm a gated op is now blocked.
#    registerEndpoint() takes no args, so it is the simplest probe. `cast call`
#    SIMULATES via eth_call and never broadcasts — use it, never `cast send`,
#    because if the halt did NOT take effect this is a real mutating (and
#    payable) operation.
cast call <CLPR_SERVICE> "registerEndpoint()" --rpc-url <RPC_URL>
# → halted:  reverts with ClprDisabled()  (custom error 0xb098fbc6)
# → enabled: returns 0x (the call would have succeeded)
```

Record the execution tx hash in the [post-mortem](#post-mortem-template) and in
the Safe change log (`docs/safe-runbook.md` §5).

## Re-enabling the service

Re-enable with the mirror-image call once the incident is resolved:

```bash
cast calldata "setClprEnabled(bool)" true
# → 0x52c3aa160000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
```

**Before re-enabling, confirm:**

- The root cause is understood and mitigated (patched verifier, recovered peer
  chain, fixed/contained slashing) — not merely quiet.
- If a verifier or trust anchor was involved, it has been rotated / updated via
  the appropriate owner call.
- The re-enable decision has the same sign-off as the halt (threshold signers +
  escalation owner agree).

Then execute as a Safe transaction (same mechanics as above) — note this
consumes a fresh Safe nonce, so the halt signatures cannot be reused — and run
the same three verification checks, inverted:

```bash
cast storage <CLPR_SERVICE> 2 --rpc-url <RPC_URL> | cut -c25-26
# → "01" = enabled

cast call <CLPR_SERVICE> "registerEndpoint()" --rpc-url <RPC_URL>
# → returns 0x, i.e. a previously-halted operation would now succeed
```

Plus `ClprEnabledChanged` with `data` = `0x00…01` and `ExecutionSuccess` in the
execution receipt.
