///      Note on state-reading functions: functions that read contract storage
///      (getChannel, getLedgerConfiguration, etc.) are NOT annotated `view`
///      because the DELEGATECALL-based router cannot use `view`-annotated
///      delegatecall dispatch in Solidity 0.8. Off-chain callers should invoke
