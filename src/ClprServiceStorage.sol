/// @title ClprServiceStorage
/// @dev Shared base class for ClprService router and all logic modules.
/// Uses OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuardTransient (EIP-1153 transient storage).
///
/// This is safe for the following reasons:
/// 1. ReentrancyGuardTransient is purpose-built for reentrancy protection — the documented
///    safe use case for EIP-1153 transient storage per the EIP specification.
/// 2. The transient storage flag is cleared at the end of each call, preventing cross-call
///    interference within the same transaction.
/// 3. OpenZeppelin's implementation correctly manages the transient state lifecycle.
/// See: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1153#security-and-composability
///
/// @notice ALL contracts in the router/logic system MUST inherit this in the same
///         order so every contract sees identical storage slot assignments.
///         ReentrancyGuardTransient stores its flag in EIP-1153 transient storage
///         at a hash-derived slot, so it claims no sequential storage slot.
///         Protocol fields start at slot 0.
///
///         Layout is grouped by change-risk so future maintainers can edit safely:
///         hot-path first, then packable scalars, then primitive-valued mappings,
///         then mapping-of-struct values, then direct struct state variables last
///         (appending fields to a trailing struct does not displace other state).
///
///         Note: Owner is stored in ClprService (via Ownable) using EIP-7201 namespaced
///         storage. Logic modules access it via direct owner() calls when executed via
///         DELEGATECALL from ClprService, which shares the same storage context.
